## Tic-Tac-Toe
A C program that explores the hashtable data structure to generate tic tac toe games
Uses makefile so "make all" before testing

# show_node
This program shows the board, tells you whose turn it is to go next(X/O), tells you how many turns have elapsed (depth), declares a winner if there is one, and lists other node numbers to see all possible moves to be made after current one. 

usage: ./show_node *node*
where *node* is the integer for which node you'd like to see (0 for start)

# count_nodes
This program counts the number of nodes in the hashtable and prints it. 

usage: ./count_nodes
